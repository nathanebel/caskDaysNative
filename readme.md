## Cask Days Native

Nate Ebel - [twitter](http://twitter.com/nateebel)

This is a concept app for Cask Days, an awesome beer festival in Toronto. (http://www.caskdays.com/)

I've been going for a few years - A common sight is people walking around with an excel sheet and a pen, keeping track of the beers they've tasted / plan to try.

Surely there's a better way for people to plan their beer adventure, so this is my take on solving that problem.

We'll see how this evolves, since I'm still getting the hang of React Native. If anyone notices a way I could be more efficient or follow better practices, I'd love to hear. Just trying to learn here.

For the record I'm not associated with Cask Days. Just a big fan who wanted to build something fun.

Status report - December 25

- Made styling more consistent across the app, added an empty state for the myList component. Fixed styling error where long brewery names were not wrapping.
